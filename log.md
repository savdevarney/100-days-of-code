### 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - SavDeVarney

### Day 1: November 17, 2017

*** Progress ***
- Worked on basic app that interfaces with Eventbrite API to show meditation classes near you (discover-meditation)
- Have worked with Eventbrite in Python but wanted to use to learn JavaScript.

*** Thoughts *** 
- JavaScript is a whole new world and I feel like I only scratched the surface @hackbright because Habot was so backend intensive. 
- I feel overwhelmed but really want to specialize in front end to start so have the motivation to power on :)

### Day 2: November 20, 2017

*** Progress ***
- worked through the entire code academy JavaScript track - was glad to see they updated for ES6. 
- implemented some ES6 optimizations (template literals - love!) in my discover-meditation app.

*** Thoughts *** 
- learning your second language is so much easier :) 
- I'm so grateful for organizations like codecademy that make cirriculum available for free.  Having a structured cirriculum is so reassuring and makes it much easier to learn than watching random YouTube videos!
