# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1: SavDeVarney

**Links to projects in round 1**
- [discover-meditation](https://github.com/savdevarney/discover-meditation): an app to discover meditation classes near you via integrations with eventbrite, meetup, facebook events, etc. 



### Day 3: November 21, 2017

**Progress**
- added npm and babel to discover-meditation.
- basic infinite scroll functionality to discover-meditation w/o library.
- pagination through eventbrite api response in infinite scroll.

**Thoughts**
- surprised to get stuck on something pretty basic - importing main.js into my page. Gah!


### Day 2: November 20, 2017

**Progress**
- worked through 80% of the JavaScript track on codecademy - was glad to see they updated for ES6. 
- implemented some ES6 optimizations (template literals - love!) in my discover-meditation app.
- learned about mark down language fundamentals to make this readme pretty

**Thoughts**
- learning your second language is so much easier :) 
- I'm so grateful for organizations like codecademy that make cirriculum available for free.  Having a structured cirriculum makes it much easier to learn than watching random YouTube videos!  


## Day 1: November 17, 2017

**Progress**
- Worked on basic app that interfaces with Eventbrite API to show meditation classes near you (discover-meditation)
- Have worked with Eventbrite in Python but wanted to use to learn JavaScript.

**Thoughts**
- JavaScript is a whole new world and I feel like I only scratched the surface @hackbright because Habot was so backend intensive. 
- I feel overwhelmed but really want to specialize in front end to start so have the motivation to power on :)
