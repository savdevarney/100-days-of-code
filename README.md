# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1: SavDeVarney

## Links to Round 1 projects
- [discover-meditation](https://github.com/savdevarney/discover-meditation): an app to discover meditation classes near you via integrations with eventbrite, meetup, facebook events, etc. During this 100 days, I plan to learn enough JavaScript to have this work primarily from the front end. 
- [learnings](https://github.com/savdevarney/learnings): notes and code snippets from all my self-study.  During this 100 days, I plan to skill up in JS(including ES6) and learn React/Redux. 
- [goslo](https://github.com/savdevarney/goslo): My first React app. A visual meditation app to pace breathing. During this 100 days, I plan to learn React and build this entirely. 
- [expanding circle](https://codepen.io/savdevarney/pen/bYQeOY): A prelude project for goslo.  A mini project to learn css animation techniques. 
- [habot](https://github.com/savdevarney/habot): My very first working web app that I created at Hackbright.  During this 100 days, I plan to add various testing modalities and build several features in preparation for deployment. 

### Day 12: December 18, 2017

**Progress**
- Got reorganized after 2 weeks of vacation.
- 


**Thoughts**
- 

### Day 11: December 6, 2017

**Progress**
- started new CSS tutorials
- #JavaScript30 D3 - CSS variables, D4 - Array Cardio & D5 - Flex Panel Gallery
- several ES6 practices last week in between interviews

**Thoughts**
- Haven't posted most of last week as I was interviewing for positions, and I got a job offer (that I accepted!) Starting as a front end engineer @ bill.com on January 2nd, so pivoting my learnings to include Angular (pausing progress on React)



### Day 10: November 29, 2017

**Progress**
- Learned CSS animations and transitions and built [expanding circle](https://codepen.io/savdevarney/pen/bYQeOY)
- More ES6 tutorials: Array methods & spread operators.


**Thoughts**
- I was so surprised to learn what you could do in CSS.  My CSS skills are still very basic and I'm looking forward to levelling up here.  


### Day 9: November 27, 2017

**Progress**
- added unittests to Habot where possible. 
- went through several ES6 tutorials.  Learned about for-of loops and generators, deconstruction, new string methods, tagged template literals.

**Thoughts**
- In ES6, JavaScript is so pythonic! How wonderful! 

### Day 8: November 26, 2017

**Progress**
- JS code challenges
- Started #JavaScript30! yeah! 
- Finished JavaScript30 D1, Drumkit and D2, CSS clock
- Started GoSlo - my first React App.  Not much than created the structure and repo yet.  Very grateful for create-react-app!

**Thoughts**
- Wes Bos, I love you :)


### Day 7: November 25, 2017

**Progress**
- Started codecademy ReactII
- Went through Wes Bos React tutorial, vol 1
- More JS code challenges on code wars

**Thoughts**
-  I'm at the 50% mark with the tutorials I have. 
-  Brain is totally overwhelmed with React things! JSX, Components, Props, Context, State, Routing, ahhh! But I can feel how/why it's so powerful and awesome.
-  Good next step:  identify a simple project I can build in parallel with finishing remainder of tutorials. 


### Day 6: November 24, 2017

**Progress**
- Finished codecademy ReactI
- Did a few JS code challenges on codewars to flex my JS muscles

**Thoughts**
- React, while super confusing to me still, is also VERY exciting and I'm totally in love with it already. 
- Really excited to discover codewars.  I feel like it matched me to the exact challenges I needed and there was a pathway to progressively level-up. 


### Day 5: November 23, 2017

Happy Thanksgiving :) 

**Progress**
- Finished codecademy React intro
- Polished some items on Habot to enable cloning (removing test user data)

**Thoughts**
- light day!


### Day 4: November 22, 2017

**Progress**
- finished last 10% of codecademy track (requests).
- created a repo for learnings for all my notes and code snippets.
- started watching Wes Bos React tutorials. 
- did a few coding challenges.

**Thoughts**
- learning via typing code (vs writing in my notebook) much more efficient for muscle memory.
- sometimes starting something is the hardest part.  I like to set myself up for success by creating files and adding the first few lines.  It makes adding to it the next day so much easier :) 

### Day 3: November 21, 2017

**Progress**
- added npm and babel to discover-meditation (thanks to codecademy section on transpilation).
- basic infinite scroll functionality to discover-meditation w/o library.
- pagination through eventbrite api response in infinite scroll.
- 90% through codecademy JavaScript track (first 20% mostly review and went quickly).

**Thoughts**
- surprised to get stuck on something pretty basic - importing main.js into my page. Gah!
- super jazzed to work out infinite scroll & pagination myself after being overwhelmed with JS library docs.
- still working out how to organize JS projects.  Encouraged after learning very basics of npm.  Like pip for JS :) 


### Day 2: November 20, 2017

**Progress**
- worked through 80% of the JavaScript track on codecademy - was glad to see they updated for ES6. 
- implemented some ES6 optimizations (template literals - love!) in my discover-meditation app.
- learned about mark down language fundamentals to make this readme pretty

**Thoughts**
- learning your second language is so much easier :) 
- I'm so grateful for organizations like codecademy that make cirriculum available for free.  Having a structured cirriculum makes it much easier to learn than watching random YouTube videos!  


## Day 1: November 17, 2017

**Progress**
- Worked on basic app that interfaces with Eventbrite API to show meditation classes near you (discover-meditation)
- Have worked with Eventbrite in Python but wanted to use to learn JavaScript.

**Thoughts**
- JavaScript is a whole new world and I feel like I only scratched the surface @hackbright because Habot was so backend intensive. 
- I feel overwhelmed but really want to specialize in front end to start so have the motivation to power on :)
